INTRODUCTION
    A CMOS inverter is a digital electronic circuit that converts input logic levels into their complementary outputs, commonly used in digital logic design for signal inversion and amplification. It utilizes complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for low power consumption and high-speed operation.
